# Computer Network Labs

This repository showcases my hands-on projects in computer networking, including both protocol implementation and network simulation labs.

##  Directory Structure
- **Lab1–4 (CS144 TCP/IP Labs)**  
  Implemented core network stack components: byte stream, TCP sender/receiver, connection management, network interface, and router.
- **Lab5–6 (Mininet SDN Labs)**  
  Built and simulated network topologies using Mininet and OpenFlow controllers.
- **Writeups/**  
  Contains detailed reports for each lab, explaining design decisions, challenges, and debugging steps.

##  Key Accomplishments
- Built a functional **TCP/IP stack from scratch** — implemented segments of reliable data transfer, flow/congestion control, etc.
- Utilized **Mininet for SDN experiments**, simulating SDN topologies with controllers and switches.
- Authored **clear and structured writeups** that demonstrate thoughtful analysis and reflective learning.

##  Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: C++, Python  
- **Tools**: Mininet, Wireshark, Linux, Git  
- **Concepts**: TCP/IP, Flow Control, Congestion Control, SDN, OpenFlow, Network Emulation
